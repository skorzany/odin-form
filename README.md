# odin-form
A sign-up form for an imaginary service.<br>
Has a basic validation for matching passwords.<br>
Here is an image with the desired design: [design.png](./design.png). (now changed, see the update section below)<br>

You can view my work on [GitHub Pages](https://skorzany.github.io/odin-form/).

The page is **not responsive**, the purpose was to practice working with forms and styling them.

## UPDATE
It seems that people from odin just recently changed their design image. Unfortunately I don't have the old one, so here are the differences:
 - they made the labels bolder,
 - they have removed the validation message entirely.<br><br>
<!-- end of the list -->
I guess their reason was to make it easier, and because those are rather minor adjustments, I've decided to not update my work as it would be a step *backwards*.
